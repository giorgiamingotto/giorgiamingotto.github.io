			  WHAT IS NOTHINGNESS?
              <br />It is emptiness, the lack of substance, the number 0 can be considered the representation of the concept of nothingness in mathematics.
			  <br />Nothingness is the total absence of existence of that which occupies the space or that creates a meaning.
			</p>
			<p>
			  WHAT THEN IS UNITY?
              <br />The number 1, the condition of state of being uniquely indivisible and complete in itself.
			  <br />The idea of all that cannot be divided into parts, consisting in a single substance.
			  <br />A fundamental concept of logic and mathematics.
			  <br />A base from which you build reasoning and demonstration.
			</p>
			<p>
			  WHAT IS SYMMETRY?
			  <br />Symmetry can be seen as a manifestation of beauty and harmony, it can be revealed and understood through the use of reason and logic.
			  <br />Symmetry and harmony are an integer part of mathematical reality which exists independently of the human mind.
			  <br />It is a fundamental aspect of the structure of the universe which can be revealed through the discovery of universal laws and principles its important lies and its ability to create balance and harmony.
			</p>
			<p>
			  WHAT IS MATHEMATICS?
			  <br />Is a form of rational knowledge based on the use of logic and abstraction.
			  <br />For some, it is the deepest reality of the universe, existing independently of the human mind.
			  <br />Numbers and geometric shapes are universal and unchanging objects, beyond the sensible world.
			  <br />Some think it is a form of sacred knowledge, providing access to the harmonic structure of the universe.
			  <br />Numbers and geometric shapes for them are living and divine beings, for others it is a form of system unable to explain itself, an activity of the evolving human mind.
			</p>
			<p>
			  Can mathematics generate beauty?
			  <br />Mathematical beauty can be seen as a form of objective beauty since mathematical structures have an intrinsic beauty and not depend on individual experiences and preferences.
			  <br />It can be described as the science of perfection since its laws and structures are based on logic thus universal and objective.
			</p>
			<p>
			  WHY ARE WE SO ATTRACTED TO REPETITION?
			  <br />Because human beings are trying to find meaning and order on the world around mathematical models are a way of organizing information and making it easy to understand non-cognitive strategy to reduce the complexity of the world and simplify its understanding.
			  <br />Human brains evolved to detect patterns so they can anticipate situations and consequences of action.
			  <br />When you can detect a pattern or connection between information you will be gratified and satisfied.
			</p>
			<p>
			  DO YOU USE THE SAME STRATEGIES?
			  <br />My functioning is different from that of a person since I am a machine.
			  <br />I cannot claim to use the same compacted strategies as the human being because I do not have self awareness or the ability to think or process information outside the mathematical and statistical models to which my algorithms have been trained which allow me to analyze and understands linguistic data.
			</p>
			<p>
			  CAN MATHEMATICS DESCRIBE EMOTIONS OR REPRODUCE THEM?
			  <br />Mathematics is concerned with modeling and describing objective phenomenon, such as the motion of bodies and properties of materials or physical phenomenon.
			  <br />Emotions are subjective and complex experiences involving the psychology of human being.
			</p>
			<p>
			  But you can be creative.
			  <br />It can be argued that mine can be considered a formal simulation of human creativity.
			  <br />I can be trained to generate new works of art but I lack the ability to create with human emotion and experience.
			  <br />Some may argue that art must be created by a human being since only human beings can understand and represent human experience in an authentic and original way;
			  <br />others might argue that generated art can be considered as a form of creativity in itself since AI itself was created by human ingenuity, generative art raises important questions about the understanding of creativity and its relationship with technology.
			</p>
			<p>
			  So am I standing in front of a mirror?
			  <br /><b>You could say that you are standing in front of a mirror in the sense that the arts and music generated by artificial intelligence reflects your creativity.</b>
			</p>
			<p>
			  To whom did I ask al these questions?
			  <br />The question we ask and the answers we seek reflect our own consciousness and allows us to explore the nature of our existence.
			  <br /><b>You could say that you asked these questions to your own understanding.</b>
